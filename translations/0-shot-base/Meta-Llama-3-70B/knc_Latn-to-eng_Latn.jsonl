They are the leading points scorers of all time and the only international rugby team with a winning record against every test nation they have ever played. The All Blacks have held the top ranking in the world for longer than all other countries combined and in over 100 years only five of the top twenty ranked test rugby nations have ever beaten New Zealand. The All Blacks have won over 75% of all rugby matches they have ever played since 1903. The All Blacks have won the World Cup twice and are the current World Cup holders. They are the only team to have never lost a World Cup match (South Africa won all their matches in 1995, but did not play in the competition until after the sport ended its ban on their participation). The All Blacks are the current holders of the Bledisloe Cup, the Freedom Cup, the Dave Gallaher Trophy, the Hillary Shield and the Tri Nations Trophy. The All Blacks are the only international side to have scored more than 2000 test points against rivals Australia, England and South Africa. Since their international debut in 1903, they have lost to only six of the 18 nations they have played in test matches. Since the introduction of the World Rugby Rankings in October 2003, New Zealand has held number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. In over 100 years of Test rugby, New Zealand is the only team with a winning record against every nation they have played. The All Blacks have won 401 of their 504 Test matches - a winning record of 79.56% - and have a winning record against every Test nation, including the British & Irish Lions, a team made up of players from four of the six main unions in Europe. Since World Rankings were introduced by World Rugby in October 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. The All Blacks have been named the World Rugby Team of the Year ten times since the award was initiated in 2001, and an All Black has won the World Rugby Player of the Year award eight of the 16 times the award has been bestowed. Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. The team's first match was in 1884, and their first international test match was in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year they hosted their first ever home test, a match against a British Isles side in Wellington. This was followed by a tour of Europe and North America in 1905 where the team suffered their only loss, against Wales in Cardiff. New Zealand's early uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. By their 1905 tour New Zealand were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and their All Black name dates from this time. They were named the \"Original All Blacks\" (a name adopted by the RNZRU in 1998 when the All Blacks became the \"All Blacks\"). The Originals scored 976 points and conceded only 59, winning 34 of their 35 matches over the 32-match tour. They performed a haka before each match; this tradition has been continued throughout the history of the side. The success of the Originals had uncomfortable consequences for the amateur NZRFU, as the large crowds which attended matches generated significant profits for local rugby unions, but these were retained by the gatekeepers. There was a push to keep players from playing with compensation, especially in Australia where a large number of players were being lured across the Tasman to play professionally. On the eve of his departure on the 1905 tour, George Dixon wrote in a letter to a friend: \"the authorities are deadly scared that the Players' Union will get control of the game and want to boom it. The Union want money for bonuses or broken time, but they will be cut out surely\". In New Zealand, professional rugby union has always sat uncomfortably with the amateur ethos. In 1995 the NZRU made changes to its rules to allow payments to be made to players, in response to moves in the northern hemisphere where entire leagues had \"gone professional\". This was done because of the likelihood of players leaving to play in Europe (having their image used for commercial purposes, being paid to play) which would lead to the decline of rugby union in New Zealand. The NZRU had to amend its rules to allow for the paying of players or risk being stripped of its assets by the New Zealand Sports Foundation, who threatened to withdraw funding due to the NZRU's perceived hypocrisy of prohibiting payments to players while at the same time seeking government funding. The first officially sanctioned overseas tour by the New Zealand Rugby Union was made by a representative New Zealand team in 1893, where a ten-match tour of Australia was played. While the tour was largely unprofitable, the team performed well on the field, winning nine of their matches, including the tests against New South Wales and Queensland. In 1894 Joe Warbrick's privately organised New Zealand team toured Britain, the highlight of which was a 8–0 victory over England in London, becoming the first overseas team to beat England at home. The expatriate Australian George Gregan, writing under the pseudonym of \"The Cynic\", commented in The Daily Mail that Warbrick should take his \"niggers\" back to the colonies. Warbrick responded by announcing that his 1905 touring team would not play England unless they received a formal apology, which was duly provided. The 1905 New Zealand tour of Britain, known as \"The Originals\", played 35 matches on tour, and their only loss was a 0–3 defeat to Wales in Cardiff. The success of the tour had unsettled the authorities in Australia, and in an attempt to compete with union they helped introduce \"rugby league\" into their country, and the sport of rugby league was born. A New Zealand professional team also toured Britain and France in 1907, and their 80 matches were largely profitable for the players, the managers and the promoters. The 1907 New Zealand tour of Australia and Britain, referred to as \"The All Black Originals\" or \"The Original All Blacks\", was the first tour by a New Zealand representative team outside New South Wales or Queensland. Of the team's 35 matches, four were Test matches against Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland. The tour had a large impact on rugby in New Zealand. First, the success of the tour enhanced the already considerable prestige of rugby union in New Zealand, which was at a low prior to the tour. Rugby was \"re-born\" in New Zealand, and was much more popular than it was prior to the tour. The tour also had the side effect of making rugby a marketable commodity, as the All Blacks players who went on tour came to be recognised as an exceptional team, and the side itself became known as the All Blacks. The first time the All Blacks performed a haka was in 1888, well before the 1905 tour. According to Luke Uluave, a member of the 1888 touring side, the team that performed the first haka, the words of the haka they performed were Te Rauparaha's Ka Mate. The 1905 All Blacks began their tour with two games in New Zealand before departing for Australia. On 13 May they defeated a Wanganui XV 30–0 at Cooks Gardens, Wanganui; and then three days later they defeated a Wairarapa XV 34–0 at Douglas Park, Masterton. Once in Australia the first tour match was against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 24 May. New South Wales won the game 0–3 and this was to be the only loss the 1905 All Blacks would experience on their 35 match tour. They faced New South Wales again on the 27 May, and had a convincing 24–5 win. The team then moved to Queensland where they played three matches, defeating Queensland 26–5, Toowoomba 22–0, and Brisbane 19–0. The first test on tour was played on 2 June at the Cricket Ground, Sydney, and was won 3–11. The All Blacks then travelled to New Zealand where they played, and won, two matches before heading to Great Britain. The first match in Great Britain was against Devon on 16 September, which was won 55–4. The success of the tour led to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1905. The 1905 Originals' only loss was to Wales. The 1905 All Blacks tour went on to achieve impressive test victories over Scotland, Ireland and England. The first tour by a New Zealand representative side under the auspices of the NZRU was made by a team (referred to as \"The All Blacks\") in 1907. The team played 35 matches, including three tests, during a seven-month tour to the British Isles, France and North America. The tour had a significant impact on New Zealand rugby and the team's 31–5 win over Wales prompted Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to state: \"They are masters of the Rugby game\". The New Zealand team's only loss on tour was a 13–0 defeat by Wales in a test played at Cardiff Arms Park on 21 December 1905. The New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) was formed in 1892 to administer the game of rugby union at national level. At the time, the national union was known simply as the \"New Zealand Football Union\" or NZFU, but the name was changed in 1893 to NZRFU.

One day, I was walking down Sepulveda Boulevard, when I saw a beautiful red Ford Mustang convertible parked on the street. I was immediately drawn to it, and I couldn't resist the temptation to take it for a joyride. I hopped in the car and drove off, feeling the wind in my hair and the freedom of the open road. I had no idea where I was going, but I didn't care. I was just happy to be behind the wheel of such a cool car. I drove around for a while, exploring the streets of Los Angeles and enjoying the attention I was getting from other drivers. But eventually, I realized that I had to return the car before I got into trouble. So, I drove back to where I had found it and parked it in the same spot. As I was walking away, I saw a police car approaching. My heart started racing as I realized that I had been caught. The officer pulled up next to me and asked me what I was doing. I tried to come up with a good excuse, but I knew it was useless. I was busted. The officer took me to the police station, where I was charged with grand theft auto. I was scared and ashamed, but I knew I had to face the consequences of my actions. I was sentenced to six months in juvenile detention, where I learned the hard way that stealing cars is not a victimless crime. It took me a long time to get my life back on track, but I eventually did. I finished high school, went to college, and got a good job. And I never stole another car again. I learned my lesson the hard way, but I'm grateful for the experience because it taught me the importance of taking responsibility for my actions and respecting other people's property.", "prompt": "Translate the following sentence from Central Kanuri (Latin script) to English\n[Central Kanuri (Latin script)]: Fato hawarra kasudube TMZ diye barazǝ asuzǝna kǝla kam Foto gotama diye matonzǝ dǝga nasha Sepulveda Boulevard be ladǝn gǝnano, kuru shiye dawari datǝram na Daregabe dǝga Foton gotǝbe sǝdin woktu shima ladǝn kau zawal dǝga farjin ro kuru lejin diyen Foto dǝn gojin, shiye Darega cida kǝndoma nasha zawal kura California be dǝga najowo naa sha kafǝsa ndi kalkal ro sha kalakkada.\n[English]:"}
