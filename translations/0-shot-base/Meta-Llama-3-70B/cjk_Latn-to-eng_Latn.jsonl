It is alleged that between 12 March and 21 May 2003, Ms Pryce, having allegedly confessed to Mr Huhne in 2003 that she had taken speeding points for him, pressured him to accept an offer from the press of no prosecution if he admitted the offence. It is alleged that between 21 May 2003 and 3 May 2011, Mr Huhne, having allegedly obtained that offer from the press, lied about the speeding offence, thereby perverting the course of justice. The CPS has decided that there is sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against Mr Huhne and Ms Pryce for perverting the course of justice. The decision was taken by Joanne Jakymec, a Principal Crown Prosecutor in the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division. She said: “After careful review of the evidence, I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence to charge both Mr Huhne and Ms Pryce with perverting the course of justice, and that it is in the public interest to do so. The essence of the charges is that between March and May 2003, Mr Huhne, having allegedly committed a speeding offence, falsely informed the investigating authorities that Ms Pryce had been the driver of the vehicle in question, and she falsely accepted that she had been the driver. It is alleged that this was done, in part, to prevent proceedings being brought against Mr Huhne for motoring offences, including speeding. It is alleged that between 21 May 2003 and 3 May 2011, Ms Pryce, having allegedly falsely accepted that she was the driver of the vehicle, pressured Mr Huhne to admit his guilt, in order to avoid her being prosecuted for the original offence of taking the speeding points onto her licence. It is alleged that from about 5 June 2010 to 8 May 2011, Mr Huhne, having allegedly obtained that offer from the press of no prosecution if he admitted his guilt, lied about the speeding offence, thereby perverting the course of justice. “May I remind all concerned that a charge is merely an allegation and that both Mr Huhne and Ms Pryce will be entitled to a fair trial. It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice that trial. For these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.” Mr Huhne and Ms Pryce will appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 16 February 2012.", "prompt": "Translate the following sentence from Chokwe to English\n[Chokwe]: Mukuluana Uatalanhikavumbi Amilimo Yambunga, Kier Starmer QC, yasoneka umue mukanda musono chimene nikulueza akutuala chaku anjika umue jina líeni Huhne chimo uikanhiPryce.\n[English]:"}
