There are 138 pyramids discovered in Egypt as of 2008. Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis, although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others. The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence. By the time of the Early Dynastic Period, those with sufficient means were buried in bench-like structures known as mastabas. The second historically-documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed to the architect Imhotep, who planned what Egyptologists believe to be a tomb for the pharaoh Djoser. Imhotep is credited with being the first to conceive the notion of stacking mastabas on top of each other – creating an edifice composed of several \"steps\" that decreased in size towards its apex. The result was the Step Pyramid of Djoser – which was designed to serve as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens. Such was the importance of Imhotep's achievement that he was deified by later Egyptians. The most prolific pyramid-building phase coincided with the greatest degree of absolutist rule. It was during this time that the most famous pyramids, those near Giza, were built. Long after the end of Egypt's own pyramid-building period, a burst of pyramid-building occurred in what is present-day Sudan, after much of Egypt came under the rule of the Kingdom of Kush, which was then based at Napata. The Kushite pyramids are in their own style, and they are generally substantially smaller than the pyramids of Egypt. The Meroitic period of Kushite history, when the \"Kushites\" formed a line of kings independent from Egypt, marks the last phase of pyramid building in Sudan (the previous Khartoum period, during the 18th and 19th dynasties, being under Egyptian rule). The pyramids of Kush, also known as Nubian pyramids, have different characteristics than the pyramids of Egypt. The Nubian pyramids were constructed at a steeper angle than Egyptian ones. Pyramids were still being built in Sudan as late as 200 AD. One of the unique structures of Ancient Egypt, the pyramid, has several architectural developments. From the original mastaba, it developed to the Step pyramids, Bent, and True Pyramids. With this development, the Egyptians were one of the few civilizations to build geometrical shaped structures, which they did with great accuracy and geometric alignment. In building pyramids, several serious problems needed to be solved: level ground was required for the base; the orientation to the cardinal points was crucial; and a sufficient quantity of stone had to be extracted from the quarry. During the third and fourth dynasties, which cover the period from about 2700–2100 BC, a number of major step pyramids were constructed: the Pyramid of Meidum, the Bent Pyramid, and the Red Pyramid at Dahshur, and the Great Pyramid of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure at Giza.

Over time, as authority became less centralized, the ability and willingness to harness the resources required for construction on a massive scale decreased, and later pyramids were smaller, less well-built and often hastily constructed.
