The Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States ended after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II. Historians do not fully agree on its starting and ending points, but the period is generally considered to span from 1947 to 1991. The term \"cold\" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race. The Cold War also saw a continuation of the alliance between the Western Bloc and the former Axis powers of Italy, Japan, and West Germany against the Eastern Bloc, while neutral countries were involved in the Non-Aligned Movement. The Western Bloc was led by the United States as well as the other First World nations of the United Nations, NATO and their allies, while the Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its satellite states in the Warsaw Pact. The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world, while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world. As a result of the Cold War, the post-war recovery of Western Europe, the 1947–1949 division of Germany, the 1949–1969 division of Austria, the 1948–1989 division of Korea, the 1949–1991 division of China, and the 1947–1991 division of Vietnam and Yemen all took place.
