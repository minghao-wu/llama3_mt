The egg is 11.1 cm long, and it has a 5.6 cm diameter. It is oval-shaped, and it is believed to have been laid by a small oviraptorid dinosaur. The dinosaur that laid the egg is called Oviraptor philoceratops. This dinosaur was discovered in 1923, by the American paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews. The dinosaur was named Oviraptor philoceratops, which means “egg thief” and “lover of the horned ones”. The dinosaur is a carnivore, and it lived in the late Cretaceous period. It was about 1.5 meters long, and it weighed about 50 kilograms. It had a long tail, and it was covered with feathers. The dinosaur is one of the most famous dinosaurs in the world. It is known for its long tail, and its feathers. The dinosaur is also known for its eggs, which are very rare. The dinosaur is also known for its name, which is derived from the Greek word oviraptor, which means “egg thief”.
