Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will behold a land that stretches afar. Your mind will muse on the terror: 'Where is he who counted? Where is he who weighed the tribute? Where is he who counted the towers?' You will see no more the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech that you cannot comprehend, stammering in a tongue that you cannot understand. Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, an immovable tent, whose stakes will never be plucked up, nor will any of its cords be broken. But there the Lord in majesty will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars can go, nor stately ship can pass. For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our ruler, the Lord is our king; he will save us. Your rigging hangs loose: It cannot hold the mast firm in its place, or keep the sail spread out.
