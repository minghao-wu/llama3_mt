The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them. Not many days later the younger son gathered all he had and set off for a distant country. There he squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.’ So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate. Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.

It covers much of North Africa, including most of the area of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia. It covers 9,200,000 square kilometers (3,600,000 square miles), including 3,500,000 square kilometers (1,400,000 square miles) of desert proper and 5,700,000 square kilometers (2,200,000 square miles) of semi-desert. It is one of three distinct physiographic regions of the Sahara and the largest, the others being the Ténéré and Reg. The name 'Sahara' is derived from a dialectal Arabic word for 'desert', ṣaḥrāʾ (صحراء). The region is located in the northern part of Africa, and is one of the driest, sunniest, and windiest regions on Earth, where rainfall averages less than 200 millimeters (7.9 inches) per year. Daytime temperatures often reach 46 °C (115 °F), and nighttime temperatures usually range between 15 and 30 °C (59 and 86 °F). The countries that lie entirely or partially in the Sahara are Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia. In the northern part of the desert, the climate is hot and dry. The Sahara is the world's largest low-latitude hot desert. The area is located in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge, a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from upper levels of the troposphere tends to sink towards the ground. The dry desert landforms are shaped by minimal precipitation, sand dunes, wind, and temperature fluctuations between day and night. The central Sahara is hyperarid, with sparse vegetation. The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands in the northeast, receive significantly more rain. In the central and central-eastern Sahara, there are several subdeserts, including the Tanezrouft, the Ténéré, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert and the Nubian Desert. The Sahara covers large parts of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia. It covers 9,200,000 square kilometers (3,600,000 square miles), including 3,500,000 square kilometers (1,400,000 square miles) of desert proper and 5,700,000 square kilometers (2,200,000 square miles) of semi-desert.
