The SANDF consists of the South African Army, the South African Air Force, the South African Navy and South African Military Health Service. It is overseen by the Department of Defence and the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, with a Secretary for Defence as the administrative head. It was established in 1994, as a result of the dissolution of the South African Defence Force (SADF) and the merger with the military wings of the African National Congress (ANC) and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) of Azania (now known as the South African National Defence Force). The SANDF is a volunteer military composed of Black, Coloured, Indian and White South Africans. The SANDF is a professional force of 73,580 active personnel and 18,600 reserve personnel, and is one of the largest defence forces in Africa. The SANDF has taken part in many international operations, including those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, the Central African Republic, and the Middle East. It is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Standby Force and the African Union's Panel of the Wise. The SANDF also has a number of joint ventures with foreign militaries, including the South African Air Force's involvement in the acquisition of the A400M Atlas military transport aircraft and the South African Army's participation in the acquisition of the Denel Rooivalk attack helicopter. The SANDF has a total budget of R47.9 billion (US$3.4 billion) and is the second largest employer in the country, behind the South African Police Service. The SANDF is the successor to the South African Defence Force (SADF), which was formed in 1957. The SADF was created in response to the threat of communism and the need to defend South Africa's borders from possible invasion by neighbouring states. The SADF was a conscript army, with a large number of white South Africans serving in it. The SADF was involved in a number of conflicts, including the Border War in Angola and Namibia, and the South African Border War in South West Africa. The SADF was also involved in the South African Border War in South West Africa, which was fought against the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) and the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN).
