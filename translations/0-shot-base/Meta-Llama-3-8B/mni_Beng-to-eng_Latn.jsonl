The films' composers are nominated for the award and are voted on by the members of the Music Branch of the Academy. The award is also referred to by the unhyphenated phrase \"Original Score Award\". The official terminology is \"original dramatic score\", but is commonly abbreviated to \"original score\". The name of the award has changed several times in its history. It was first presented in 1934 as Best Music, Original Score, and in 1935 as Best Score. In 1936, the category was divided into two separate categories, one for original score and one for original score adaptation, and in 1939, the two categories were merged to create the single award. The award is generally presented to the composer, but on some occasions it is presented to the specific song writer or lyricist. The Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song were created separately in 1940. The Academy has placed several restrictions on the award. First, the film must have a substantial body of music that is original and written specifically for the film. The music must also be written by one composer. Films whose music comes from previously written material are not considered. This includes music that is pre-existing, such as songs from a Broadway musical, and music that is adapted from another piece of music. The film must also be feature-length. The film's score must also be a substantial body of music, rather than a song or two. In addition, the Academy has placed restrictions on the use of pre-existing music. A film may not use more than 10% pre-existing music, and the music must be used in a way that is not a major part of the film. The film must also be in wide release. The film must also be released in the United States in order to be eligible for the award. The Academy also has rules that govern the use of music in the film. The music must be used in a way that is not distracting to the film. The music must also be used in a way that is not distracting to the viewer.

The important north-south road connecting the Croatian capital city Zagreb to the Adriatic coastal city of Split passes along the park. The protected area extends over 296.85 square kilometres. The park is world famous for its lakes arranged in cascades. Currently, 16 lakes can be seen from the surface. These lakes are a result of the confluence of several small rivers and subterranean karst rivers. The lakes are all interconnected and follow the water flow. They are separated by natural dams of travertine, which is deposited by the action of moss, algae, and bacteria. The particularly sensitive travertine barriers act as organs of reinforcement and disintegration: on one hand, they constrain the lakes and separate the water flow; on the other, they are subject to constant destruction and rearrangement by the effects of nature. The morphological activity of this process and the great biological diversity make Plitvice Lakes a unique natural phenomenon.
