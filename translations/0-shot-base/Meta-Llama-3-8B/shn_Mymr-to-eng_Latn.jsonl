In January 2018, the Academy announced that it had appointed a committee to investigate the allegations against Arnault. The committee found that Arnault had sexually assaulted a number of women, and that he had been involved in a number of other sexual assaults. The committee also found that Arnault had been involved in a number of other activities that had caused damage to the Academy. The committee recommended that Arnault be expelled from the Academy, and that the Academy be dissolved. The Academy accepted the committee's recommendations, and dissolved itself.

They thought that the vaccine could make the child sick and that it could even kill him. Today, however, most people believe that vaccination is a safe and effective way to protect children from diseases. Vaccines are made from the germs that cause the disease. When a child is vaccinated, the vaccine stimulates the body’s immune system to produce antibodies against the disease. The antibodies protect the child from the disease if he is exposed to it later.

Machu Picchu was built as an estate for Pachacuti's wife, the Inca princess, and was both a royal retreat and a sacred site devoted to the worship of Inti, the Sun God. In 1911, Bingham was searching for the lost Inca city of Vilcabamba, and his guide led him to the ruins of Machu Picchu. Bingham realized the importance of the site, and he notified the Peruvian government. The site was quickly excavated and restored. In 1983, the ruins of Machu Picchu were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site is open to the public, and there are several hotels and restaurants located nearby. Machu Picchu is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and it is estimated that over 1 million people visit the site each year.", "prompt": "Translate the following sentence from Shan to English\n[Shan]: မိူဝ်ႈပီႊ 1976 ၼၼ်ႉ လႆႈမႄးၵုမ်းၶိုၼ်း Machu Picchu ယဝ်ႉတူဝ်ႈတႃႇႁူဝ်ပၢၵ်ႇသၢမ်သိပ်းယဝ်ႉ လႄႈ လႆႈသိုပ်ႇလုမ်းလႃးမႄးၵုမ်းၶိုၼ်းမႃးယူႇတေႃႇထိုင်ဝၼ်းမိူဝ်ႈၼႆႉယဝ်ႉ။\n[English]:"}

It is believed the pyramid was built as a tomb for Fourth Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops in Greek) and constructed over a 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface, and what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories regarding the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.

The Shan people have a long history of resistance against the Burmese government. They have fought for independence from Burma for many years, and have been involved in many armed conflicts with the Burmese army. The Shan people are a minority ethnic group in Burma, and have been marginalized and discriminated against by the Burmese government. The Shan people are a proud and independent people, and have a strong sense of identity and culture. They have a rich history and culture, and are an important part of the cultural heritage of Burma.

It damages the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a wide range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. MS is a chronic disease that can be unpredictable. The severity of the disease varies from person to person. Some people may be mildly affected while others may be severely disabled. The disease can also vary in severity over time. Relapses can occur, and remissions can occur. MS is the most common inflammatory central nervous system disease in young adults and is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in younger people. It is also the most common non-traumatic cause of neurological disability in young adults. The disease is most common in temperate regions, and is rare in tropical countries. The disease can occur at any age, but most commonly it is diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40. It is twice as common in women as in men. MS is a chronic disease. There is no cure, but treatment can help manage the disease. This includes medication, rehabilitation, and support. The main symptom of MS is a relapsing-remitting course where patients experience attacks of worsening neurologic function, followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions). Between 85% and 90% of MS patients experience this form of the disease. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent changes to nerve fibers and scarring (sclerosis) in the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, but symptoms can begin in childhood or later in life. The disease is more common in women than in men.

The nerve cells are surrounded by a fatty sheath called myelin. The sheath is made of many layers of fatty material. It is the sheath that allows the nerve cells to send messages from the brain to the rest of the body. The nerve cells are called neurons. The myelin sheath insulates the neurons and allows them to send electrical signals at very high speed. The myelin sheath is damaged in MS. The damage to the sheath interferes with the electrical signals between the brain and the rest of the body. The sheath is damaged by the body's immune system. The body's immune system is designed to protect the body from foreign substances. In MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is not foreign to the body. It is part of the body. The body's immune system is supposed to protect the body, not attack it. In MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath and damages it. The damage to the myelin sheath causes problems with the body's nervous system. The body's nervous system controls many functions of the body, such as the ability to move, see, hear, and think. When the myelin sheath is damaged, the body's nervous system is damaged. The damage to the nervous system causes the symptoms of MS. The symptoms of MS include: numbness, tingling, weakness, stiffness, and loss of balance. The symptoms of MS are caused by the damage to the myelin sheath.
