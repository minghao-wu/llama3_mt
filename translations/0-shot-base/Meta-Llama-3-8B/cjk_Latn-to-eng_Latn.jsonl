When Tyler was seven, his parents divorced. Victor married his second wife, Bebe, and moved to New Hampshire, taking Lynda with him. Tyler remained in New York with his mother. As a child, Tyler practiced the piano constantly and also learned to play the harmonica. His mother later married her third husband, a vice principal at a local high school. Tyler has said that he was physically abused by his stepfather. Tyler attended Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, New York, where he was a member of the marching band, playing the baritone. He was a fan of Elvis Presley, but was more interested in rock and roll than classical music. Tyler had his first taste of fame as a child, when he and a friend formed the band The Strangeurs, which played at a high school dance. The band was not a success, and Tyler soon quit to form a new band, Chain Reaction, with guitarist David Johansen. Tyler and Johansen later formed a new band, the Chain Reaction.
