This was the prevailing global framework for the period 1947–1991, and was characterized by a series of large-scale political and military confrontations between the two superpowers, the Soviet Union with its Communist allies of a \"socialist camp\" and the United States with its allies within the capitalist \"free world\". Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but 1947–1991 seems the most commonly accepted beginning date. The Cold War began to de-escalate when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The term \"cold\" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. Aside from the nuclear arsenal of the two superpowers, the conflict was waged on economic, military, technological, ideological, and political fronts. Propaganda, each side, especially the United States, tried to persuade third-world countries and their allies to their side. The Cold War took place on three levels: ideological, political and military. The Soviet Union and the United States competed for military and political alliances and economic influence, especially in the Third World. The two nations also competed in the arms race, the Space Race, and the development of supercomputing. The resulting hostility hampered cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in their search for a solution to worldwide problems such as nuclear proliferation, and prevented them from working together to address issues that required bilateral cooperation to solve, such as the division of Germany. The Cold War was often characterized as a contest for dominance between what has been called the \"First World\" (the Western Bloc) and the \"Second World\" (the Eastern Bloc). A third bloc was the non-aligned nations. It was called the \"Third World\". The Cold War was not fought on the same scale as World War II, but it was a significant conflict in its own right. The Cold War was characterized by the two superpowers as each other's primary threat. However, neither power went to war with the other. The Cold War led to military spending at record levels, and the two superpowers squandered their wealth in an arms race. The two superpowers never engaged in a direct military conflict, but several times came to the brink of direct military conflict and were involved in several \"proxy wars\" in which they supported opposing sides in conflicts. The Cold War ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The U.S. and the Soviet Union were the main antagonists in the Cold War.

The script is a written document that describes each scene and line of dialogue in the film. The script is written by a screenwriter, who works closely with the director to create a story that will be engaging and entertaining for the audience. Once the script is completed, the next step is to cast the film, which involves finding actors to play the roles in the film. The casting process can be quite competitive, as the best actors are often in high demand. Once the cast is assembled, the next step is to begin filming. This involves setting up the shots, lighting the scenes, and working with the actors to create the desired performances. The filming process can be quite time-consuming, as it often involves multiple takes to get the shots just right. Once the filming is complete, the next step is to edit the footage. This involves selecting the best shots and putting them together in a way that tells the story in the most effective way possible. The editing process can be quite challenging, as it involves making decisions about what to include and what to leave out. Once the editing is complete, the next step is to add special effects and music. This can involve using computer software to create realistic effects, such as explosions or flying cars. It can also involve hiring a composer to create a musical score that enhances the mood and emotion of the film. Once the special effects and music are added, the film is ready for release. This involves distributing the film to theaters, streaming services, or other platforms, and promoting it to the public. The release of a film can be quite exciting, as it is the culmination of months or even years of hard work and dedication. In conclusion, the process of making a film is a complex and multifaceted process that involves many different steps, from writing the script to releasing the film to the public. Each step is crucial in creating a successful and engaging film that will captivate and entertain audiences around the world.", "prompt": "Translate the following sentence from Tigrinya to English\n[Tigrinya]: ናይ መጀምርትኣ ስላሎም ነበረ፣ ኣብኡ ድማ ኣብ'ቲ ናይ ፋልማይ ጉያ ውድድር ብፎርፊት ተሳዒራ። ኣብ'ቲ ቅድድም እቲ፣ 36 ካብ'ቶም 116 ተወዳደርቲ ተመሳሳሊ ውጽኢት ነይርዎም።\n[English]:"}
