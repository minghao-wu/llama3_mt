This stood in contrast to the World War II alliance against the Third Reich. The Cold War's origins can be traced to 1917, when World War I Allied powers, including the United States and the United Kingdom, fought against the Bolsheviks in Russia, and in 1945, when the United States and the United Kingdom fought against the Soviet Union and its allies in World War II. In the aftermath of World War II, Western democratic states organized into the NATO military alliance and the Soviet Union organized its satellite states into the Warsaw Pact. The two sides supported different sets of political, economic, and social systems and differed widely in social and political ideology. The principal belligerents were the Soviet Union and its satellite states in the Eastern Bloc, the United States with NATO and often its allies, and the states of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Cold War was built on military tactics and strategies; however, it did not turn into a hot war with full-scale military conflict between the two superpowers, except for proxy wars in Poland, Angola, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Syria. The Cold War and decolonization after World War II defined the political and economic geography of Europe for most of the second half of the 20th century. The Cold War and its events dominated the foreign policy of the United States, and its origins are often traced to the 1917–1921 Russian Civil War between the Bolshevik Red Army and the White Forces. The Cold War and its events also had a major impact on the domestic policies of many nations around the world. The Cold War is sometimes described as a war of ideologies, with two different ideas about the best way to organize society competing for supremacy. However, the Cold War was also a war of economics, with two different ideas about the best way to organize an economy competing for supremacy. The Cold War was also a war of culture, with two different ideas about the best way to organize a culture competing for supremacy.
