The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos, \"milky circle\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.

The study adopted a quasi-experimental design. The population for the study consisted of all senior secondary school students in Kano State. A sample of 120 students was selected from the population using the simple random sampling technique. The students were assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group was taught biology using literature-based instructional strategy while the control group was taught using conventional teaching method. The instrument used for data collection was a biology achievement test. The data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, t-test and ANCOVA. The results revealed that there was a significant difference in the mean scores of students taught biology using literature-based instructional strategy and those taught using conventional teaching method. It was also found that there was a significant difference in the mean scores of students taught biology using literature-based instructional strategy and those taught using conventional teaching method after controlling for the initial achievement.
