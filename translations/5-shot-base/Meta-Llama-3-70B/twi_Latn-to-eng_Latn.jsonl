Also, the skis (both cross-country and Alpine) and the boots allow maximum comfort and control. Cross-country skiing is part of the Nordic skiing sport family, which includes ski jumping, Nordic combined (cross-country skiing and ski jumping), Biathlon (skiing and rifle marksmanship) and Telemark skiing. Cross-country skiing is the oldest type of skiing. It emerged from a need to travel over snow-covered terrain for purposes of transportation, and evolved into a sport. Early historical accounts suggest that skiing was practised 6000 years ago in what is now China, and was practised widely in Scandinavia, as well as in the 30-year Kalmar War against Sweden, where snow conditions were decisive to the outcome of several battles. The term \"ski\" comes from the Old Norse word \"skid\", a split length of wood. The first written reference mentioning use of skis was in Sondre Norheim's birthplace, Oppdal, Norway, which stated that: \"...in 1431, during the election of bishops, the rural dean in the village spoke of the excellence of ski which is called \"skedde\" or \"skidde\". In modern Norwegian this word is written as \"ski\". Skiing was primarily used for transport until the mid-19th century, but since then has also become a recreation and sport. Military ski races were held in Norway during the 18th century, and ski warfare was studied in the late 18th century. As equipment evolved and ski lifts were developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, two main genres of skiing emerged—Alpine (downhill) skiing and Nordic skiing. The main difference between the two is the type of ski binding (the way in which the ski boots are attached to the skis). In Nordic skiing the heel of the ski boot is not fixed to the ski, so the skier must pick up the heel with each step to move forward. In Alpine skiing the heel and toe of the ski boot are fixed to the ski, allowing the skier to slide down a hill with both feet fixed on the skis. In Nordic skiing, cross-country and Telemark skiing are two ski techniques that branch from the original form of skiing. Compared to Alpine skiing, the ski boots and skis used for cross-country are light and designed to allow a forward and aft striding motion that mimics walking or running. Both Telemark and cross-country skiing evolved from simply transporting oneself over snow. Telemark skiing developed in the Telemark region of Norway in the late 19th century. Cross-country skiing originated in Fennoscandia and Russia and remains their national sport. It was still widely used for transportation in northern Europe and the United States until the late 19th century and from the mid-19th century was also recreational. The word \"ski\" itself is one of a handful of words Norway has exported to the international community. It comes from the Old Norse word \"skid\", which means \"a piece of split wood\". The first written reference to skiing is said to be in the Icelandic sagas, which describe a ninth century Norwegian called Skidfor Edvaldson who \"had the art of skiing well\". However, the earliest record of skiing in Norway dates back to 5000 B.C. with the discovery of a rock with markings depicting a skier. The word \"ski\" is a Norwegian word which comes from the Old Norse word \"skid\", a split piece of wood. The oldest and most accurately documented evidence of skiing in history is found in modern day Norway and Sweden. The earliest primitive carvings circa 5000 B.C. depict a skier with one pole, located in Rødøy in the Nordland region of Norway.
